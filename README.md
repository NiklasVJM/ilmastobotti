Yeah, sorry again. This bot is running in Finnish, so the documentation is a nice mix of Finnish and English.

Overall, the program first generates a number between 1-4 (since there's 4 different scenarios to choose from atm) and executes that
scenario and tweets the tweet. Tweet is composed of random lines from .txt -files, which I can update later. Same is with the scenarios. 
I'm plannin on moving the tweeting-section to it's own function later on, since now it is copied several times.
